# earley-parser
My implementation of the Earley parser for syntactic parsing of sentences according to a context-free grammar (CFG). (Implemented for Question #3 of Assignment #2, COMP 599, McGill University.)

### Usage

```
python earleyparser.py <grammer_file>
```

Reads sentences from standard in, one at a time, printing the parses to standard output using pretty_print(), with parses separated by an extra newline. For sentences that do not have a parse according to the grammar, it prints the sentence back out, unchanged.

Running with the `draw` option, like so,

```
```
